# How to use the XRCrossTab control to create a cross-tab report


The following example demonstrates how to use the [Cross Tab](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XRCrossTab?v=19.2) control to generate a [cross-tab report](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/4226/create-popular-reports/create-a-cross-tab-report?v=19.2) in code.


In this solution, [SqlDataSource](https://documentation.devexpress.com/#CoreLibraries/clsDevExpressDataAccessSqlSqlDataSourcetopic) is used as an XRCrossTab data source.
